Both directories are ignored by Git; never force-add or upload them. Run `corepack yarn package:local` from the repository root to rebuild, preserve the previous executable and upgrade in place; append `-NoLaunch` to build without launching.

DSH Desktop integrates the local Web UI, Host service, and plugin system from [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) into a native desktop application. It runs a pinned upstream version unchanged, while DSH Desktop provides the window, tray, terminal, updates, and work profiles through the plugin mechanism provided by DeepSeek Harness.

### First-run setup, browser access, and LAN exposure

On the normal first launch of each uninitialized profile, Desktop shows its native Setup Wizard first. It can configure the window mode and system material, plugin marketplace, notifications, whether to open the system default browser automatically, and the Web access scope; it can also be skipped. The Host and main DSH window do not start until the wizard is completed or skipped. Completion or skip state is recorded separately for each profile; an explicit recovery launch still enters Recovery Assistant first.

The Web service listens on the local loopback interface by default. When **Open in browser** is enabled, Desktop hands the page to the system default browser after the Web service is actually ready; this preference does not change the listener exposure. **Desktop settings** shows the actual local URL below the control. LAN access is a separate opt-in setting and exposes the currently available LAN URLs when enabled.

> **Danger:** LAN exposure has no authentication. Anyone on the same local network can open DSH and directly operate your computer. Enable it only on a fully trusted network and with great care.

The automatic updater's fixed version-check request sends the installed version in the `X-DSH-Desktop-Version` header and a locally generated, persistently stored random UUID in the `X-DSH-Desktop-Installation-Id` header; the value is not derived from hardware information. Package download requests and their download redirects do not receive these headers.

## Plugin Ecosystem

Plugins are extensions that add capabilities to DSH — models, tools, interfaces, and workflows can all be plugins, combined like building blocks.

DSH Desktop does not modify upstream source, and it is not a fixed, hardcoded shell. A pinned upstream DeepSeek Harness version runs unchanged; the desktop shell itself — the window, tray, terminal, updates, and work profiles — integrates as a DSH plugin through the plugin mechanism provided by DeepSeek Harness. From the core agent to the desktop shell, the whole product follows the same "everything is a plugin" rule: plugins compatible with the pinned upstream version can be used, while desktop capabilities are composed, replaced, and evolved in the same way.

We want the plugin ecosystem to work like a phone app store: every plugin is built against the same set of rules, so plugins can be installed together and work together without interfering with each other.

### For developers

Unlike many other projects, this project itself is a DSH [plugin](docs/plugin-development.en.md): the desktop shell uses the same plugin composition mechanism as third-party plugins. Desktop plugin capabilities are now available. We provide Desktop services so plugin developers can integrate their plugins with desktop capabilities: for example, viewing and switching work profiles, or installing, updating, and removing plugins in the active profile. See the [Desktop plugin API](dsh-plugin-desktop/docs/plugin-services.md) for complete usage details. See [Why DSH Desktop](docs/why-desktop.en.md) and [Plugin development](docs/plugin-development.en.md) for the reasoning and the third-party boundary.

## Relationship to DeepSeek Harness

DSH Desktop is an independent community project built on [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) and the Cordis plugin model, intended to provide an open and composable DSH desktop experience.

This repository is independently maintained by the community. No DeepSeek employee or member of the official upstream DeepSeek Harness team currently participates in its development, maintenance, or governance. Contributors from the upstream project may appear on GitHub's Contributors page because this repository inherited and later synchronized upstream commit history when it was forked. Such attribution reflects commit provenance only and does not imply involvement in this repository or any affiliation, partnership, authorization, or endorsement.

The upstream project provides the core agent capabilities, plugin system, and Web UI. DSH Desktop primarily provides:

- Desktop application packaging
- Starting, stopping, and recovering the local service
- Desktop window and system tray integration
- macOS and Windows installer builds and releases
- An interface designed for desktop use

If you prefer to run DeepSeek Harness from the command line or contribute to its core functionality, refer to the upstream repository first.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to the [original DeepSeek Harness repository](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) and the DeepSeek AI team. DSH Desktop is built from a pinned upstream checkout, and its core agents, models, tools, sessions, Web UI, and plugin ecosystem come from that project.

We also thank [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis) for the plugin foundation that makes this composition possible. DSH Desktop would not exist without these open-source projects.

We are also grateful to the [Koishi.js](https://koishi.chat/) project and community for their long-standing work on plugin practices, tooling, and shared knowledge, and to everyone who contributes discussions, testing, feedback, and plugins.

Also, and you.

<a id="run-from-source"></a>

## Development

Desktop source lives in `dsh-plugin-desktop/`. The outer repository uses Yarn, while the pinned `deepseek-harness/` submodule keeps its own pnpm workspace. From the repository root:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
corepack yarn install --immutable
corepack yarn dev
```

Use `corepack yarn check` for the headless gate. The [architecture](docs/architecture.en.md) and package [`README`](dsh-plugin-desktop/README.md) describe the full build, test, and release boundaries. See [CONTRIBUTING.en.md](CONTRIBUTING.en.md) for how to contribute.
